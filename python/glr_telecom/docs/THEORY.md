# Theoretical Background

## Universal Binary Principle (UBP)
Euan Craig, New Zealand 2025 with ai assistance from Grok (Xai, Gemini and Manus ai.

The UBP posits that reality operates as a computational system using multidimensional Bitfields. Key concepts include:

### Bitfields
- 12-dimensional conceptual space
- Projected into 6-dimensional operational space
- Approximately 2.7 million cells

### OffBits
- 24-bit vectors padded to 32-bit
- Toggle between on/off states at 10^-12 seconds
- Organized into four layers:
  1. Reality Layer
  2. Information Layer
  3. Activation Layer
  4. Unactivated Layer

### E, C, M Triad
- Existence (E = 1)
- Speed of Light (C = 299,792,458 m/s)
- Pi (M = 3.14159)

## Golay-Leech-Resonance (GLR)
GLR provides error correction and signature generation within the UBP framework.

### Key Components
- Golay (24,12) Code
- Leech Lattice
- Temporal Signatures
- Frequency Correction
